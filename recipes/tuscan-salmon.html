    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Tuscan salmon takes you on a trip to central Italy, with this Tuscan-inspired main dish. 
        Lots of flavors you love make a bed for some lovely pan-roasted salmon. 
        Everything can be done in one skillet, and if you'd like a side of pasta, clean up will still be a breeze. 
        We like this with risotto, a salad, and a good crusty bread, too!</p>
    <h3>Ingrediens</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (5 ounce) salmon filets</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 or 3 short rosemary sprigs, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chopped prosciutto</li>
        <li>1 green onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 lemon, zested</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 cup cherry tomato halves</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) package fresh spinach, torn</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil for drizzling, or as needed</li>
        <li>lemon slices</li>
        <li>lightly toasted pine nuts (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat salmon filets dry with paper towels and season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; add olive oil. 
            When butter stops sizzling, swirl the skillet to combine. 
            Add 2 or 3 rosemary sprigs to the skillet, to flavor the oil.</li>
        <li>Add salmon and cook until salmon is lightly browned and flakes when a fork is gently inserted, 
            about 3 minutes per side. (If salmon filets are thinner than 1 1/2 inches, this may take less time.) 
            An instant read thermometer, inserted near the center, should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). 
            Remove from the skillet, and keep warm.</li>
        <li>To the same skillet with rosemary, add chopped prosciutto, green onion, garlic, 
            red pepper flakes, and lemon zest, and cook for 1 minute or until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add white wine and cook until the liquid evaporates. 
            Add tomatoes and cook, stirring, 2 to 3 minutes. 
            Add spinach and toss in the skillet until bright green and barely wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in cream, and season with salt and pepper. 
            Cook until sauce bubbles, about 2 minutes, and remove cooked rosemary sprigs.</li>
        <li>Serve salmon on a bed of vegetables and sauce, and drizzle with a little olive oil. 
            Garnish with lemon slices, fresh rosemary sprigs, and toasted pine nuts, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
